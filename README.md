# Engagement Bot for Uni

To setup the bot run the `setup.py` file and configure the variables in `GetCreds()` function in `main.py`.

Note that you need to download the most recent version of [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) that supports your chrome version (likely version 96), and place the executable into the same folder as `main.py`. You may also have to add it to the PATH if the same directory doesn't work.

This bot will:
- Login
- Access a random canvas resource
- Logout
